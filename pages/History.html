        <h2 class="title">1976–1982: Expansion era</h2>

        <article>

            <P>
                As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to
                28
                teams. In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community
                leaders,
                announced its intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle. In June 1974, the NFL gave
                the
                city an expansion franchise. That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing
                of
                the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners
                for
                the consortium.<br><br>
                In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and
                a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name
                Seattle
                Seahawks ("Seahawk" is another name for Osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming
                contest
                which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.<br><br>
                Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a
                Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced
                on
                January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay
                Buccaneers
                alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league. The
                Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve
                Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the
                San
                Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome.<br><br>
                The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch
                conferences twice in the post-merger era. The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC
                West
                but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment
                was
                dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each
                other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their
                first
                two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the
                former of
                which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.

        <h2 class="title">1983–1991: Chuck Knox era</h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made
                their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the
                Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles
                Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it
                would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season. Knox won the NFL
                Coach of the Year Award.<br><br>

                In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a
                reported $80 million. The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs
                for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team.

        <h2 class="title">1992–1998: Continued playoff drought and change in ownership</h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons
                (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the
                1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.<br><br>

                In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California–a widely
                criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in
                bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not
                move the team's operations back to Seattle; with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft
                co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.<br><br>

                Erickson's tenure as head coach ended after the
                1998; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their
                playoff drought to ten consecutive seasons.

        <h2 class="title">1999–2009: Mike Holmgren era and return to the NFC</h2>

        <article>

            <p>
                In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach. He would coach for 10 seasons. The Seahawks won their
                second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs.<br><br>

                In 2002, the Seahawks
                returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced
                divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster
                of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland. That same year, the team opened its
                new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the
                Kingdome's implosion in 2000.<br><br>

                In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise
                history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3, which included a 42–0 rout
                of the Philadelphia Eagles in a Monday Night Football game. The 13–3 record earned them the number one
                seed in the NFC. They won the NFC Championship Game in 2005, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the
                Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten
                list of games with controversial referee calls. Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls
                that altered the game. Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a
                streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six
                straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the
                Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.<br><br>

                Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season,
                following the end of his contract. Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor.
                In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record. Shortly after, Mora was fired on
                January 8, 2010.

        <h2 class="title">2010–present: Pete Carroll era</h2>

        <article>

            <p>
                In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9
                record. They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams
                7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by
                overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record).
                In the playoffs, the Seahawks won in their first game against the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the
                New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's
                67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a
                small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle
                and was nicknamed the "Beast Quake." The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24.<br><br>

                The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona
                Cardinals, after the highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter,
                and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts
                in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to
                an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins
                over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the
                playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card
                Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins. This was the first
                time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road. However, in the
                2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the
                #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the
                Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28. QB Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year
                award.
