            Marshawn Terrell Lynch (born April 22, 1986) is a former American football running back who played in the
            National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons and part owner of the FCF Beasts. Nicknamed "Beast Mode" for
            his
            powerful running style, he spent the majority of his career with the Seattle Seahawks. Lynch played college
            football at California, where he earned first-team All-American honors and became the school's second
            all-time
            career rusher. He was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft and played
            three
            full seasons before joining Seattle during the 2010 season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Playing for the Seahawks from 2010 to 2015, Lynch was voted to four consecutive Pro Bowls, made one
            first-team
            All-Pro selection, and twice led the league in rushing touchdowns. He also helped the team win their first
            Super
            Bowl title in Super Bowl XLVIII. His Beast Quake touchdown during the 2010â€“11 NFL playoffs, where he rushed
            for
            67 yards while breaking nine tackles, is considered one of the greatest NFL runs. Lynch retired in 2015
            following an injury-plagued year, but returned to the NFL in 2017 with the Oakland Raiders. After two
            seasons,
            Lynch retired a second time until he reunited with the Seahawks in 2019 for their last regular season game
            and
            playoff run. Since retiring for a third and final time, he has co-owned the Beasts of Fan Controlled
            Football
            (FCF) and the Bay Area Panthers of the Indoor Football League (IFL).
