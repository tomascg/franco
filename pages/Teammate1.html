                Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Denver
                Broncos of
                the National Football League (NFL). He played college football and baseball at NC State from 2008 to
                2010
                before
                transferring to Wisconsin in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passing efficiency
                (191.8)
                and
                led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the
                Tri-City
                Dust
                Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. As of 2019, his professional
                baseball
                rights are held by the Somerset Patriots, the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees.

                Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft.
                After
                beating out Matt Flynn for the starting job during training camp, Wilson ended up having a successful
                debut
                season, tying Peyton Manning's then-record for most passing touchdowns by a rookie (26) and was named
                Pepsi
                NFL
                Rookie of the Year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wilson has been named to nine Pro Bowls and helped lead the Seahawks to two consecutive Super Bowls,
                winning
                Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos. He holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine
                seasons
                (98) and is one of four quarterbacks in NFL history with a career passer rating over 100.In April 2019,
                Wilson
                signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, making him the highest paid
                player in
                the
                NFL at the time. In 2020, he became just the third quarterback in NFL history to throw for thirty
                touchdowns
                in
                four consecutive seasons. Wilson is widely regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks in
                NFL
                history.
